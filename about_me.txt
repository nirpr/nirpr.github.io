I’m a software engineer who tackles complex technical challenges by quickly mastering new tools. Passionate about machine learning, with a focus on medical data, I also specialize in backend development, where I enjoy understanding and implementing the underlying logic of systems.

Fun fact: I play basketball for Maccabi Ra’anana in the fourth league, and we’re currently tied for first place!
